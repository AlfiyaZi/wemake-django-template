Linters
=======

This projects uses several linters to make coding style consistent.


Project linters
---------------

flake8
~~~~~~

``flake8`` is used a general tool for linting.
It includes several plugins, which could be found in ``Pipfile``.


isort
~~~~~

We also use ``isort`` to check import order.


Running project linters
-----------------------

Just run ``pytest``. It will run style checks as well.


Additional linters
------------------

We use several additional linters that are not
integrated into the ``pytest`` pipeline.

pylint
~~~~~~

We also use ``pylint`` at CI step. But it is not a mandatory tool.
Violation of any ``pylint`` rules do not break the build.

You may be wondering why are we using ``pylint`` in such strange manner?
Well, there are two reasons:

1. ``pylint`` is really good
2. ``pylint`` is very strict. And it is not usable with tools like ``django``

``pylint`` fails on different ``django`` magic like ``.objects``, but
reports generated by ``pylint`` are very useful.

See ``docker/ci.sh`` for more details.


Configuration
-------------

All configuration is stored inside ``setup.cfg``.
